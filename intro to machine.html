    <p> <h1>Machine Learning Algorithms:</h1><br>
    	Machine learning (including deep learning) is a study of learning algorithms.
A computer program is said to learn from experience 𝐸 with respect to some
class of tasks 𝑇 and performance measure 𝑃 if its performance at tasks in 𝑇,
as measured by 𝑃, improves with experience 𝐸.<br>
    </p>

  <h1>Main Problems Solved by Machine Learning</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Machine learning can deal with many types of tasks. The following describes the most typical and
common types of tasks.
<ul>
  <li>Classification: A computer program needs to specify which of the k categories some input belongs to. To accomplish
this task, learning algorithms usually output a function 𝑓: 𝑅𝑛 → (1,2, … , 𝑘). For example, the image classification
algorithm in computer vision is developed to handle classification tasks.</li>
<li>Regression: For this type of task, a computer program predicts the output for the given input. Learning algorithms
typically output a function 𝑓: 𝑅𝑛 → 𝑅. An example of this task type is to predict the claim amount of an insured
person (to set the insurance premium) or predict the security price.</li>
<li>Clustering: A large amount of data from an unlabeled dataset is divided into multiple categories according to
internal similarity of the data. Data in the same category is more similar than that in different categories. This
feature can be used in scenarios such as image retrieval and user profile management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Classification and regression are two main types of prediction, accounting from 80% to 90%. The output
of classification is discrete category values, and the output of regression is continuous numbers.</li>
</ul>
