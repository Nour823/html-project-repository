    <p> <h1>What Is AI?:</h1><br>
    	Artificial Intelligence (AI)is a technical science that studies and develops theories, methods, technologies, and applications for simulating and extending human intelligence. This term was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956. McCarthy defined the subject as the "science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs". The purpose of AI is to enable machines to think like people and to make machines intelligent. Today, AI has become an interdisciplinarycourse that involves various fields.

  <h1>Relationship Between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>AIis a technical science that studies and develops theories, methods, and applications for simulating and extending human intelligence.</li>
<li>Machine learning specializes in how computers simulate or implement human learning behaviorto acquire new knowledge or skills, and reorganize existing knowledge structures to improve their performance continuously. It is a subset of artificial intelligence. Any system without learning ability can hardly be considered a real intelligent system.</li>
<li>Deep learning is developed based on the study of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multiple hidden layers has a deep learning structure. Deep learning is a new field of machine learning. It aims to establish a neural network that simulates the human brain to analyze and interpret data, such as images, sounds, and texts.</li>
